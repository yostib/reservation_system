- [x] **RSRV-0001 : Reservation time restriction**

  As a user I should be able to make reservation between 9:00 to 21:00. There should be a time restriction for reservations.  

- [x] **RSRV-0002 : The reservation form should have a half-hour interval**

- [x] **RSRV-0003 : Add `startTime` and `endTime` in the form.**
- [ ] **RSRV-0004 : Reservation form validation** 
  - [ ] RSRV-0005 : The `endTime` cannot be before the `startTime`. 
  - [ ] RSRV-0006 : The smallest amount of time the user should be able to book is one hour.
  - [ ] RSRV-0007 : The laundry machine ID should be a dropdown select. (This task still needs to be refined)
  - [ ] RSRV-0008 : The available slot for laundry should be displayed per machine selection. Example, one machine could be available for booking when the other is all booked.
  - [ ] RSRV-0009 : The sauna room number should be a dropdown select.
  - [ ] RSRV-0010 : The available slot for sauna should be displayed per room selection.
- [ ] **RSRV-0011 : The reservation is missing end time.**
